got panic. His tongue, lips, palate and jaw was not completely grown. But after a month when I went to hospital for the check up I met Dr. Karoon Aggarwal, he told me 

that my son will become healthy and normal very confidently and I have to bring my son every month for check up and take care of him in correct manner, he also told me 

that there will be no expenses for the treatment, then I got all the information from CIPA about how to take care of my son. He also said that he will operate and 

write prescriptions, then I joined the team CIPA. CIPA always supported me and helped me in taking care of my son. By the help of CIPA my son's first operation was 

successfull, but his second operation got cancelled because of the deficiency of haemoglobin, then CIPA helped me and called me again and again and told me various 

methods and the deficiency of haemoglobin was cured. Dr. Karoon Aggarwal gave the next date of second operation but I was scared because before three days of operation 

my son was having cold then again CIPA team helped me and my son's cold was cured then operation was done and it was successful. Due to CIPA's help my son's both the 

operation were successfully done on time, first operation was done in nine nonths and second in fourteenth month. After both the operations my son was facing problem 

in speaking so CIPA team helped me to find a doctor for speech therapy through which my son started speaking correctly. Now I have become a member of CIPA to help 

other parents who are facing the same problem as my son's tratement was only possible by the help of CIPA without any expenses my son got the correct treatment at 

correct time.      </p>
